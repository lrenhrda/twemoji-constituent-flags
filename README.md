Constituent Flags for Twemoji
-----------------------------

# About

While there are currently no Unicode codepoints set aside for use as subnational flag emoji, there may be instances where one wishes to support them. This repository contains SVGs of subnational or constituent areas of the world, such as the states of the United States. In the future, it may contain subnational flags for additional nations. All icons are designed to fit with the style of Twitter's original [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) icon set.
